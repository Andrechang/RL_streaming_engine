The proposed RL mapper is a key component of the SE device toolchain.
It can search for optimal mappings while using the learning to map other previously unseen workloads more efficiently.
This improves upon the total time required to get mappings as compared to the existing manual placement approach and also reduces the amount of manual labor required.
It also allows for an automated search of mappings with different optimizations and trade-offs.
In this paper we have given a brief overview of the SE device architecture along with an analysis of how different design choices in terms of simulating the SE and neural network design impact the quality of mappings obtained. As future work we wish to explore:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing sample efficiency of learning methods and improving the simulation environment for the SE by adding more constraints. 
    \item Integration of RL mapper into the SE toolset.
    \item Investigate the application of the proposed techniques for broader problems such as chip placement.
\end{itemize}
